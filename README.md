Introduction

The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React / Redux, and Node.js. The MERN stack is one of the most popular JavaScript stacks for building modern single-page web applications.

In this tutorial, you will build a todo application that uses a RESTful API, which you will also build later in this tutorial.
Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to install node and npm on your computer. If you do not have node installed, follow the instructions on the nodejs website. You will also need a code editor that you are familiar with, preferably one that has support for JavaScript code highlighting.
